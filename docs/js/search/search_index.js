Angular\nStack\n\n\nAbout\nThis web application is meant to be the web platform used to manage data collected on the ionic mobile application Puente Data Collection\nAngular Framework\nAngular is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application platform led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Those powerful capabilities are brought to Angular because it provides mobile-friendly HTML, JS, and CSS components to developers.\nParse Server\nParse Server is an open source version of the Parse backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Its repository on Github.\nBuild and Run\nInstall\ngit clone \ncd THIS_PROJ\nnpm installRun\nnpm run start:localBuild\nFor debug build\nnpm run buildThe build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. \nFor production build\nnpm run build:productionCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nLook at the structure of the project in order to generate component in the correct location\nng generate directive|service|etc /providers/componentName/componentNameThis will create a folder for the component in the providers directory with the correct files inside that folder\nKnown Issues\n\nNeed to set environmental variables for local development/production \nNeed to set mongo migration for demo data\n\nContribution\n\nReport issues\nOpen pull request with improvements\nSpread the word\nReach out to me directly at \n\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\nThis project uses Material Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
